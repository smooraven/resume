        <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <h3>Cook/Service (09/2000-10/2001)</h3>
            <h4>McDonalds<img src="./assets/images/mcdonalds-logo.png" height="25" alt="mcdonalds logo"/></h4>
            
                <p>After an extensive course in OH&S and a brief lesson on cooking burgers I was aimed at the kitchen during school rush with the unspoken message “sink or swim”. I swam, displaying excellent communication skills, initiative and learning on the fly. Although I did begin to develop my leadership skills towards the end of my time in this role, more importantly I learned how to operate as part of a team.</p>
            
            <h3>Farm-hand/Labourer 08/2003-11/2003</h3>
            <h4>Ost Farms (Canada)<img src="./assets/images/flag.png" height="25" alt="candian flag"/></h4>
                <p>For my 18th birthday I was sent to Canada. I lived with my Uncle and his family in Medicine Hat, and worked on local farms. Doing anything required of me, from bailing/stacking hay to welding gates and putting up fencing. I adapted quickly to the cooler conditions and long hours. I learned a lot and loved the exercise. Unfortunately I had to return home when we couldn't secure a work visa. </p>

            <h3>I.T. Contractor (Graphic Manipulation) 12/2003-05/2004</h3>
            <h4>Humanics<img src="./assets/images/gears.png" height="25" alt="humanics logo"/></h4>
                <p>Working from home, I was performing graphic manipulation and digital enhancement of detailed specimen photos for The Senior Curator of the Queensland Museum. This required a premium quality end product in an expeditious fashion, I developed a strong work ethic, and an ability to execute an efficient method of completing multiple tasks by a set deadline.</p>

                <p>I have lived with panic attacks throughout most of my teen years. I was finally diagnosed with a mild case of Schizoaffective disorder which required stress-free convalescence for full recovery. I was placed on the Disability Support Pension so that I could cover living expenses. In the last 14 years I've undertaken various therapies and treatments for my condition and have not shown any signs of the illness any time in the past 2 years (as of 2018). My medical and family support team has given me a clean bill of health to undertake formal work again. I also feel back to normal and want to work.</p> -->
