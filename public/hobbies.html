    <h1>Interests and Activities</h1>
    <p>I enjoy playing online computer games, where I can socialise with friends (sometimes into the early hours of the morning), <br />
        experience leadership roles and frequently work as part of a team. I also enjoy working on computers as much as I like to play <br />
        them, hardware, software or network - It's my puzzle on a rainy day.</p>
    <p>When my eyes start to go square I like to get covered in grease working on my car/motorbike. From a minor service to replacing <br />
        the turbo, I like to keep my vehicles running smooth and reliable.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of a Social Motorcycle Club for many years, and currently hold the office of Treasurer, I enjoy the long <br />
        rides with trusted friends and fundraising for various charities and causes.</p>
